# ConformalPrediction

In this repo, I want to test conformal prediction and compare it to other methods to generate prediction intervals, such as quantile regression or quantile regression forests.

The examples mainly come from [MAPIE](https://mapie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), who have implemented several methods for conformal prediction. However, I want to apply the method to another data set, so I'm using the [GEFCom2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207016000133) data set.
